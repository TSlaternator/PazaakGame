Version 0.4.0: (Multiple Sets)

 - The game is now played over multiple sets
 - Each set involves the players drawing cards until they decide to hold, or exceed 20 points
 - The winner of each set is determined as previous
 - Special hand cards are retained between sets, and none are drawn after the original 4
    - this means using them strateigically is important
 - The winner is the first person to win 3 sets


Version 0.3.0: (AI Playable Cards)

 - Improved AI to allow it to play cards
 - AI threshold for holding now changes based on the amount of cards in its hand, and the players


Version 0.2.0: (Playable Cards)

 - Added special playable cards, ranging from +6 to -6, allowing players to change their current total
 - Players can play up to one card from their hand per go
 - Players draw a hand of 4 special cards at the start of the game, and never draw more
 - One type of card can be either a negative or positive value, making them even more useful
 - Added a button to allow the player to change the sign on their special cards from + to - or vice versa
 - The AI currently draws a hand of special cards, but has no ability to play them yet (will add next update)


Version 0.1.0 (Initial Commit):

~~~ The goal of the game is to draw cards (with values 1 - 10) to get a total as higher than your oponent, without exceeding 20. Players take turns drawing a card and choosing whether to hold their current total, or carry on drawing ~~~

- A deck of cards will shuffle at the start of the game
- Player and AI can draw cards from the deck, and choose to hold, or carry on (starting the other players turn)
- Basic AI added, which will choose to hold at advantageous times
- Currently can only play one round, and a console message will be written when the player wins, loses or draws
